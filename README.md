# Salon Luxe ‚Äì Next.js Project

This project is a modern redesign of the Salon Luxe website, created to showcase my growth as a web developer. The original Salon Luxe site was my first website project. With this new version, I wanted to highlight my improved skills and create a fully interactive, visually appealing site.

## My process
I started by planning the site structure and designing reusable components for pages like About, Contact, and Products. Then I:

1. Set up a Next.js project with TypeScript.

2. Built reusable React components for sections, cards, buttons, and forms.

3. Integrated Firebase for authentication and data management.

4. Added AI chatbot functionality for user interaction.

5. Optimized images and video backgrounds for a polished visual experience.

6. Deployed the site to Vercel for production-ready hosting.
